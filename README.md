# Thin Lens 

It is a simple Java Script application where a user can select between Converging and Diverging lenses. In the application, one can manually set the Focal length of the lens, the object distance and object height. In addition to that, the application is interactive and the objects can be moved by clicking on the screen. The image moves as a function of the focal length, and the Object distance and height. The numerical values of Object distance and height are visible for cross checking with theoretical values.
